## Differences between BU111 and BU121
* You hand in using MyLS DropBox + TA office in hardcopy
* Bonus Social Enterprise Proposal (2%) + Competition
* Participation is worth more (5% for prep + 5% contribution)

## Business Models
* Business model transforms an idea to a business
* Reading (Chapter 1 + Week #2 Lab Manual) - syllabus for information

## Learning Objectives
* What a business model is
	* Why companies with essentially the same product (good or service) might have different business models
	* How a company's business model affects how it operates
* Why is it important to understand business models
* How to build a business model
	* The different building blocks that make up a business model
	* Some of the common patterns found in business models
	* The process of building a business model and how to apply it
	
## What is a Business model?
> A business model describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers and captures value
* A business model tells you how the business intends to make money
	* Reflects the stategic decisions and trade-offs that entrepeneurs make to earn a profit
* Different companies can have similar offerings but different business models

## Example Business Models
* Gilette
	* Lower price upfront, however you spend more money replacing blades and shaving cream
* Electric Shaver
	* Higher price upfront, no more costs later
	
## Impact of Business Model
* Model affects strategy/ways of operating
	* Blueprint describing how an organization operates
* Subscription-based (consumer reports) vs advertising-based (vogue) revenue model
	* Focus on selecting content readers willing to pay for vs selecting content to attract readers advertising want to sell to

## Movie Theatres Example
* Movies themselves are expensive, sell tickets at cost and make profits on refreshments
* Refreshment stand staffing critical
	* Long lines dissuade customers, staff try to upsell
	
## Why does it Matter?
* Business models are "at heart stories -- stories that explain how enterprises work"
* When you hand in the narrative, everything has to connect like a story
	* Precisely delineated characters
	* Plausible motivations
	* Plot that twists
* Traveller's cheque was incredible successful, American Express
* A successful business model represents a better way than the existing alternative
* When a business model doesn't work - fail narrative or numbers test
	* Narrative - flawed logic, limited strategic choices, and incorrect assumptions about value chains
	* Numbers - imperfect value creation and capture assumptions
	
## Building a Business Model
* Value Proposition
* Customer Segments
* Distribution Channels
* Business Activities
* Associated Resources
* Revenue Sources
* Costs & Drivers
* Strategic Partners

## Business Model Canvas
* Review: An idea is not a business! You also need scalability.
* The biggest mistakes of business models is they say one block at a time in a disconnected fashion

## Business Model Patterns
* Multi-sided platform (example: hospital)
	* Value is created by facilitating interactions between two or more distinct but interdependent groups of customers
	* Of value to one group only if the other groups of customers are also present - and grows in value to the extent that it attracts more users (network effect)
	* Often solve by one segment subsidizing another
* Examples of multi-sided platforms: Visa/Mastercard, eBay, newspapers, Video game consoles, Facebook/SnapChat/YouTube/Twitter/Google
* Visa cards - if you don't pay the bill then you pay interest

## Analyzing Google
* Free Search -> Web Surfers
* Montizing Content (AdSense) -> Content Creators
* Targeted Ads (AdWords) -> Advertisers
* AdWords is the system Google uses to make money off of targetted ads
* The platform with targetted AdWords was critical

## Business Model Patterns Continued
* FREE
	* At least one substantial customer segment is able to continously benefit from a free-of-charge, financed by another part of the business model or by another cusomer segment
	* Different patterns make the free offer possible
		* Adertising (multi-sided, newspaper, social networking sites)
		* Freemium
		* Bait & Hook
* Examples: Google, Skype, Free mobile phones, Gillette

## Freemium
* You get the basic service for free, enhanced features cost money
* For example, in Skype, you pay for the pre-paid or subscription to call mobile phones

## Bait and Hook
* Gilette - low upfront cost, followed by making money later on
* Built-in lock-in, using patents, because otherwise you could buy any razor instead of Gilettes.
