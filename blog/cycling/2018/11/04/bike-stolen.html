    <p>On Saturday November 3, 2018 I decided to spend the day going on a warmup 65km ride down to Mountain View from San Francisco, meet up with a couple friends, then come back by Caltrain as preparation for a hard Sunday ride going up King’s Mountain.</p>

<p>On the return trip, the Caltrain was closed for repairs, so I had to take a bus from San Bruno to San Francisco. I tried to put my bike inside the bus, but the driver refused stating that it’s against their policy - so I put it on the rack outside. Looking out the window into darkness, the bus drove comfortably on the highway until getting to Market and 6th avenue.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/sf-mta-rack.jpg" alt="I'm an inline-style link" /></p>

<p>There was a red light at Market and 6th avenue, and out of the corner appears one person who rushes to the front of the bus, and before I could blink snatches the bike off the rack. I saw it unfold entirely with my own eyes, but by the time I could react it was too late.</p>

<p>The bus driver opened the door and I took a run for it, chasing the thief. I had my cycling shoes on, which if you aren’t aware allow me to clip my feet into my pedals. Of course, the disadvantage is that you can’t run in them - in fact even walking on pavement is difficult.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, it wasn’t just me and that guy who snatched the bike - he had a couple friends joining the party as well. They actually followed me on other road bikes, and warned me to not even try running after him. Eventually I lost sight, and getting into a physical fight with several other guys on me wouldn’t be wise. The bus driver already called 911 and the police arrived.</p>

<h3 id="what-went-well">What went well</h3>

<p>Looking at the bright side first, there’s a couple things that went well.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I didn’t have my wallet in my saddle bag (which could have been stolen in the process)</li>
  <li>Did not get mugged in the process (so phone/wallet were ok)</li>
  <li>No injuries occured</li>
</ul>

<p>As well, my initial instinct was to chase them. But if I did catch up to them - what would I gain?</p>

<p>I may have knocked the guy off the bike, and taken off:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I would need to clip-in my pedals fast enough + accelerate so he can’t chase me
    <ul>
      <li>I could hold ~55km/h for 60 seconds to get far enough from him</li>
      <li>Crashing into people, cars or red lights are of concern to maintain that speed</li>
      <li>The benefit is that I would keep my bike</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Success rate of clipping in on for both feet is ~15%, high failure rate</li>
</ul>

<p>If I failed to clip-in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extremely dangerous since I’d be in direct harm of the thief</li>
  <li>Partial clip-in means that I’m basically bolted to the bike</li>
  <li>It wasn’t just one person but at least one other
    <ul>
      <li>2 vs 1 and they likely have knives (which I’ve seen many people carry around)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Below is a picture of sidewalk the thief rode on (though it happened at night):

<h3 id="what-didnt-go-well">What didn’t go well</h3>

<p>I should have made sure my bike never leaves my hands. The issue with this is that you actually can’t lock the bike on the buses. I also explicitely asked to have the bike in the bus, but the driver refused.</p>

<p>Lastly, I also didn’t have the serial number with me. When the police was there on the scene, it would have been very valuable to have the serial number with me.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-did-after-it-got-stolen">What I did after it got stolen</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The bus driver called 911 and I did as well after my failed chase - and the cops arrived on the scene</li>
  <li>I showed bike pictures and described the thief - and they alerted nearby cops to be aware of the event
    <ul>
      <li>Interestingly, I overheard the radios police actually describing bikes being ridden in the area</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After getting home, I retrieved the serial number and reported the incident online to the police</li>
  <li>I religiously checked Kijiji, eBay and other websites for the bike or its respective components</li>
  <li>Posted on Facebook groups making other people aware of the theft</li>
  <li>Looked into renter’s insurance to see if I could make a claim</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="good-news">Good news</h3>

<p><strong>Update (November 13, 2018)</strong>: My renter’s insurance happened to cover the entire road bike - so I got all my road bike’s value back and will be buying another one :)</p>
