<p>I’ve been running my YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ComputerBunnyMath123" target="_blank">SoftwareEngenius</a> for the past six years. Initially, it started as a place to post videos regarding my hobbies (mostly computer tutorials and programming videos). It has mostly stayed that way, with more recent videos being very focused on software development.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Sometimes it may count under 1.2 million -  it’s either statisics not updated or unlisted videos.</p>

<h4> Motivation</h4>
<p>I had a fantastic experience building out my YouTube channel, and I don’t regret the many hours spent on this channel. The following, however, is worth noting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The goal of the channel isn’t about “becoming popular” or “getting rich”, rather it was more for me to genuinely produce content that I thought had some value. Unfortunately, this also means I don’t have much interest in production quality, and felt like getting my thoughts out are more important than spending time editing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe I was successful in reaching my goal. I was able to make a clear amount of videos covering a wide span of topics, though it clearly shows as some of my videos aren’t of the best quality. From 2013-2015 I gained momentum and my channel was growing, and to keep that going I was heavily invested in producing more quantity, which at the time led to saturation in my video content.</p>

<h4> Beginning: 2012/2013</h4>
<p>This was the starting phase of the channel, back when it was called <code class="highlighter-rouge">ComputerBunnyMath123</code>. Clearly, I didn’t have any niche in mind, so I began by posting completely random videos including programming tutorials, software videos and some games including Minecraft, Chess and Brain Age 2. I didn’t get many views at the start, only after adding more content (~20 videos) did I start getting over 1,000 views per month.</p>

<h4> Growing Content and Saturation: 2013/2014/2015</h4>
<p>This period I would characterize as gaining many more views, which led me to wanting more and produce vasts amounts of videos. It was mostly sparked by my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEvY27PB6ZU" target="_blank">Ripley’s Aquarium video</a>, which got over 20,000 views early on and motivated me to continue producing random content. This continued for some time, and I spent most of the Summer of 2014 reaching out to companies to review their products.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say this period of time was used effectively - I ended up greatly saturating my channel with a wide array of random topics which led to very poor user retention.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/youtube-growing.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4> Focused and Slowing Growth: 2016/2017</h4>

<p>During this time period I didn’t have a lot of time to devote to making videos (I was busy applying to university or in my freshmen year), so I had to focus my efforts. By this time, I gained some exposure to various Computer Science concepts more in-depth, and made the decision to change the focus of the channel to be <em>only software related</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/youtube-maturing.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4> Matured and Rarely Updated: 2017 onwards</h4>
<p>I hadn’t uploaded many videos recently, occasionally only when I visit an interesting concept or learn something more niche I would bother to make a new video. I don’t actively pursuit creating videos for the views or fame. Instead, if I find something cool I’ll share it! Some notable videos during this time period includes my functional programming channel or an <em>upcoming series I am working on</em>!</p>

<p>More interestingly though, is despite the lack of posting videos I didn’t drop much at all in terms of revenue or views. Personally, I find this surprising because many of my videos tags included <code class="highlighter-rouge">2014</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">2015</code>, but seems despite this I’m still getting traffic.</p>

<h4> Future Plans</h4>

<p>I have no plans for this channel. If I find something cool - I will make a video and post it :)</p>

<h4> More Analytics!</h4>

<p>Who doesn’t enjoy numbers and charts? Below are standard analytics provided by YouTube.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/youtube-views.png" alt="link" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, my most popular videos aren’t representative at all of my channel as a whole - but this goes to show how luck with tags and spotting a niche can help bring in more viewers.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/youtube-device.png" alt="link" /></p>

<p>I find it interesting how the time spent on mobile is almost as much as on the computer - and that such a large proportion of viewers watch on phone or tablet.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/youtube-traffic.png" alt="link" /></p>

<p>Interestingly, it looks like YouTube’s recommender systems worked in my favour from August 2014 to February 2015 and then rarely suggested my videos until late 2016….</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/youtube-age.png" alt="link" /></p>

<p>There are no surprises here, the vast majority of viewers will be “tech savvy” and likely near college age.</p>

<p>All in all, hope you enjoyed these facts and numbers :)</p>

Interestingly, there were more Macintosh users than Windows until around late 2015. This is likely because I used to have more content for Mac users. More interestingly, is that Mac and iOS users tend to watch my videos for longer!
